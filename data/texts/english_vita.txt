Hyrule Kingdom had been in peace since the Hero Link had defeated the evil forces which threatened it.
Once his quest was complete, he ran away from honor and fame and crossed the seas, hoping to find unknown territories where he could quench his thirst for adventure.
Although his journey took him through countless kingdoms, his attention was not caught until he happened into a bar, quite by mistake, and was told of a rumor...
He heard about a legendary place, the most popular seaside destination at the time: the famous Fairy Island.
Was it his hero instinct that made him sail there in all haste?
However as he approached the island shores, Link was attacked and beaten by a terrifying sea monster.
About time! If you're trying to get sunstroke, that's the way to go!
That being said, sunburns can't be such a big risk for someone dressed the way you are...
Not too resourceful, are you? OK, I'll stay with you until you reach a village.
I guess you're alright, in the end. I'll help you a bit more, then. Use Right ¾9 to move me around and increase your vision perimeter.
You're not as hopeless as I thought. I'll help you a bit more. Use Right ¾9 to move me around and increase your vision perimeter.
Aren't you hopeless! Alright, it looks like I'm gonna have to help you a bit more... Use Right ¾9 to move me around and increase your vision perimeter.
You don't seem to need it right now, but I can heal you if you need. Hold down LTRIGGER while pressing ¾4 if you want me to do it.
By the way, I can heal you if you need. Hold down LTRIGGER while pressing ¾4 if you want me to do it.
Oh, and I can heal you, too. Surely you could use that. Hold down LTRIGGER while pressing ¾4 when you want me to do it.
Still, healing costs magic. You'll need to wait for me to regain magic before I can heal you again. Check the gauge at the top left to see how much I have left.
Look, a village! Find the chief's house, I'm sure he can help you.

You've accepted his quest straight away... I'm impressed. I think I'm going to stick with you, you might just be able to help me too.
So you're going on a quest... I'll go with you, I'm sure I can make myself useful.
Wow... That was a bit hasty! I'd be surprised if you survived 2 minutes without me! I guess that means I'm gonna have to go with you...

This area is restricted, by order of the mayor. Those who've ventured past this point never made it back...
The mayor said you could go??? He must be pretty mad at you...
Anyway, who am I to discuss his decisions?
...
I often do my grocery shopping at the market.   Luckily, I don't have to pay as much as the tourists do!
This is the perfect weather for a bit of music. Let's see if it lasts!
Why are there chickens everywhere in town???
It looks like our streets are now rid of        chickens... I hope I won't ever bump into one again, they kind of scare me...
You're in Shell Village, the most popular place on the island! Feel free to spend all your money here!
By the way, if we're going to spend some time   together, we might as well introduce ourselves. My name's Navi, I'm a really young fairy.       What about you?
Link? You're a Hylian knight? Alright, that will have to do. Nice meeting you!
Well done, Link! Getting that medallion was no  problem at all, it would seem! I know you still have a lot on your plate, but I also have a quest for you...
Yes, we made it! We did alright, I think.       It might not be that easy for you, but I have a quest I'd like you to accept...
Honestly, I didn't think we would make it.      Still, I have a quest I would like you to take on...
I am a very young fairy. I was actually born    shortly before you arrived on this island. I need you to help me find the other fairies of the island, it would really mean a lot to me.
Don't worry, I'm sure we will find them on our  way to the remaining dungeons. After all, this is Fairy Island!

Welcome to Piece of Heart Village! If I were you, I wouldn't go wandering in the mountains up North or in the cemetery to the East. I wouldn't try the Swamp in the South, either.
Actually, the safest option would be to stay here forever.
You can buy all sorts of things at the Piece of Heart Village market place. Even pieces of heart!!!
Not that I would know what to do with them, really...
In the old times, the island was crawling with tourists. Not anymore, though.

It looks like there are no hostile creatures in this cave. That's something, I guess.
You should try and read the sign in front of you, you could get some important clues.        Press ¾2 when you're standing before it.
Well done!                                      If you need the help section, press SELECT.  Let's see what happens if you open this chest.
Press ¾3 to lift light objects such as pots and signs.
There is a crack in this wall. Coming back later with an explosive item would probably help opening the way.
I am the Great Fairy of the Jungle. I can improve your gear to assist you in your quest.
I shall begin with your gloves, they look worn out.
This bow has not yet reached its true potential. Let me improve it slightly.
Your boomerang will not last long in such a state. Let me take care of it. 
Equip the items you would like me to improve for you to show them to me.
I have done all I could to help you. Good luck!
You found the Power Gloves!!!                   You can now lift heavier objects!
You got the Megaton Gloves!!!                   You can now lift even the heaviest of boulders!!!
You found a Bow!!!                              You can now fire powerful arrows!
You got the Fairy Bow!!!                        Your arrows have become quite deadly and can even harm ghosts!!!
You found a Boomerang!!!                        Press ¾5 to open the menu and equip it. Throw it with ¾1.
You got the Fairy Boomerang!!!                  You can now throw it even farther, it will always come back!!!
Welcome, you two. I shall increase Navi's       magic to assist you in your quest.
I have done all I could to help you.            Good luck!
Navi has reached level 2!!!                     Her magic gauge has increased and she has learnt a new spell that can temporarily increase your strength!!!
Navi has reached level 3!!!                     Her magic gauge has increased and she has learnt a new spell that can temporarily increase your defence!!!
Navi has reached level 4!!!                     Her magic gauge has increased!!!
Navi has reached level 5!!!                     Her magic gauge is now at its fullest!!!
I am the Great Fairy of the Lagoon.             I shall increase your magic gauge to assist you in your quest.
Your magic gauge has doubled and will now refill itself continuously!!!
You got a new Heart Container!!!
You managed to defeat that monster???           Good! He's been crashing here for weeks, I was just about to throw him out.
Well, I suppose your help was welcome. He didn't look very cooperative...
Here, take these flippers. Thanks to them, you'll swim like a Zora!
You got Flippers!!!                            Deep water will never stop you again!!!
So... Helping me out was nice and all, but...   could you please leave, now?
You got the Fairy Ocarina!!!                    You can now learn pretty melodies!
You found the Magic Hammer!!!                   You can now smash cracked rocks and crush the pegs that block your way!!!
I am the Fat Fairy of the Desert.               I can help you provided you give me a huge amount of rupees!!!
I have enough rupees for a lifetime, you leave  me alone now.

I have increased the maximum amount of arrows   you can carry.                                  You're welcome.

Force gems are mysterious and highly magical objects. They can be found in all parts of the island.
If you already found one or more force gems, the inventory menu's bottom left corner displays how many force gems you own.
When you own the force gem detector this number can be displayed in three different colors.
White if you didn't find all of the force gems in the area.
Yellow if you found all of the force gems in the area you're in but missed some in caves, houses or adjacent areas.
Finally, if you found all of the force gems in current and adjacent areas, houses and caves, the number will be displayed in green.
The blue tunic was very in vogue last year. It's really tough and increases the wearer's defense by one point.
As for the red tunic, it's very fashionable this year. It increases defense by two points, one more point than the blue tunic.
The cane of Byrna is a magical object making the wielder invulnerable and deals damage to enemies.
Yet it costs a lot of magic when it's activated, and it works only as long as you have magic.
If you own Pegasus boots, hold RTRIGGER to run faster. They're expensive but are a real advantage during a fight.
The South-East path goes to the Lagoon. The mayor forbade access to this path when the Zoras started attacking tourists.
If you want to go that way, you'll need a throwing weapon to activate the sphere and open the way.
Welcome to Fairy Island, you're the first tourist to reach our shores alive since a sea monster started destroying every ship that has approached.
I'm this village's mayor, but I cannot do much against the disaster hitting this island...
You want to know more? Well... If you trust the legend, long ago, on a shooting star's night, a dreadful creature fell from the sky.
This monster had an evil aura that turned all near by beings into monsters devoted to it.
The island's fairies, led by their queen, fought the monster and won. But the fairy queen had consumed all her power in the fight, and she disappeared.
Fairy island has lived in peace since that day, but fairies don't show up any more, they're probably too sad since their queen's death.
Last few weeks, monsters have started appearing again on the island... I'm afraid the creature hasn't truly been vanquished...
If my fears are true, it slowly regained its strength and prepares to strike and will definitely destroy the island.
It must be hiding in the old fairy sanctuary, where fairies fought it. The entry is sealed and cannot be opened unless you gather the temple medallions from the island's seven temples.
I sent guards to gather the medallions, but monsters appeared.
You say you want to help? It's quite sudden, but if you can gather all 7 medallions and vanquish the creature while it is weakened, victory may be possible...
I don't make a habit of sending our precious tourists to death, but you look self assured, and I'm intrigued by the firefly following you...
If you can gather decent equipment - that is at least a sword, a shield, and a map of the island - I'll grant you access the jungle temple, North from here.
Let me offer you this bag full of barter items to thank you for your kind intentions:
You got a barter items bag!!!                   Press ¾7 to view its contents!
Your equipment looks ok...                      Speak to the guard at the northern gate, he'll let you pass. Good luck!
Jungle Temple is North from here. Good luck!
Please, find the 7 medallions quickly, you're our only hope!
You gathered the 7 medallions? I knew I could trust you!
Go see the mayor of the Piece of Heart village. He'll know what to do with it.
Get rid of him, once and for all!
What can I get you?
There are gossips about... Hic! ... Some guys pretend they've seen a tourist hanging around with a fairy... Hic!

Welcome in my saloon!

The village has been really quiet lately...

Hi, pal! I'm an archery expert, my best score is 47 points!

Basic targets are worth only one points, ghosts are two points, and crows 10.
But you cannot hit ghosts with a classic bow, and crows are really fast.
Avoid blocks, they don't give any points and are here only to make the game more difficult.
You scored [v=1] points at the archery stand??? Well done champion!
Ok, good luck!
I'm the mayor of Gem village. I've heard about your quest, but there is nothing I can do to help you... Still, welcome in our village!
There is a large desert north from here. Tourists never came back from it, and the mayor blocked it's access.
But we messed up and had to redo it. First time, we blocked access to the village...

I taught my first apprentice recipes to craft potions using barter items. His potions are simple yet effective.
My second apprentice can mix two level 1 potions to create a level 2 potion. The resulting potion combines effects of both level 1 potions.
My third apprentice can mix two different level 2 potions to craft the ultimate potion.
You crafted every possible kind of potions? Impressive!
Ok, Good luck.

It's not a joke, I truly need it...
Hi! You can stay awhile if you want!
I'm this village's mayor. I've been informed of your quest, and I will help you if you find all the medallions.
The medallions are not enough to open access to the fairy sanctuary. You also need to play the elegy of emptiness inside the portal cave, North from here.
I'm going to teach you this song, pay attention:
You also need to play the elegy of emptiness inside the portal cave, North from here.
Good luck, we trust you!
There's a hidden passageway in the desert. Remove all stones from the fairy shaped picture counter-clockwise starting with the lighter ones to open it.
Oh, I forgot ... In the end, take off the stone in the middle.
No path leads to the ice temple... It's disturbing...
I inherited a stock of frosty rocks. I'm very attached to it, but I could give you one for a tapestry, a charm and a perfume.
Deal?                                                                 [c=2]YES[c=0]                                             NO

You have found the Ice rod!!!                   You can now send powerful freezing projectiles!!!
Link, I owe you an explanation.
Long ago, on a shooting star's night, a dreadful creature arrived on this island and the corruption started.
It's mere presence slowly turned the island's animals into bloodthirsty monsters.
Fairies are inherently peaceful, but I had to go and fight it...
Well ok, it found us as we were hiding in our sanctuary, but it's the same!
I used all my power to defeat it, and disappeared, for I didn't have enough magic left to stay in this world.
Unfortunately, as you may have guessed, the creature survived its wounds. I therefore decided to reincarnate to fight it again.
I looked for the other fairies to retrieve my former power as fast as possible, and thanks to you, I managed to do so.
I was... I am Navi the Fairy Queen.
You brought me to my temple, here I can summon Ragnell, Sword of the Goddesses. With it's power and my magic, we shall be able to vanquish the curse plaguing MY island.
Take this sword, Link!
I have enough rupees for now, leave me alone!
You cannot save due to the creature's aura... You'll have to get out of this dungeon to save.
LINK!!!! LIIINK!!!
LINK!!!! LIIINK!!!
It's not over Link!                             You must keep your sanity a little longer, we can defeat this monster!
It might be more difficult than planned...      The monster's aura is really strong in this dungeon, if you spend too much time in here, you could be turned into a monster...
One by one your hearts will become purple. When all your remaining hearts are purple, you'll turn into a monster.
If this happens, I won't be able to turn you back in any way, it would be an instant game over...
Not only that, but it seems you cannot save inside the dungeon. Be very careful and go out of the dungeon as often as you need.
We're getting closer, Link!                     Unfortunately, it also means the evil aura is stronger on this floor. Be careful!
We're really close, now!                        The aura is becoming oppressive... Hold on!
... We did it Link...                           The island is now free from this curse!        Well done!
And that's how Link, Hyrule's hero, also saved the legendary Fairies Island from the monster that plagued it.                                                                                         The dreadful creature fed on the island's magic. Fairies had ran away from it, but when it disappeared, they started coming back to the island.                                                                                             The Fairy Queen assumed commmand to hunt the last monsters and restore peace.                                                                          All was ready to welcome tourists again!
According to the legend Link stayed there for awhile out of concern for the island's recovery and to make sure no new danger threatens this era of peace.
